## 🎯 What is *Pingganan*?

Pingganan is a web application built with **OutSystems**, designed to … *(describe the main purpose: e.g. manage orders, track inventory, assign tasks, etc.)*

It delivers a slick, fast, browser-based experience — but is powered by a low-code backend, meaning we get:

* Rapid development and deployment ([Infomax Systems Solutions and Services][2])
* Cloud infrastructure, secure hosting, and high availability ([OutSystems][3])
* Scalable modules, easily maintainable UI & data models

---

## ⏱ Why we chose OutSystems

OutSystems offers a **low-code, cloud-native** platform that dramatically speeds up building enterprise-grade web apps. Some of its big advantages:

* Visual development & model-driven programming — build apps in days rather than months or years. ([Infomax Systems Solutions and Services][2])
* Built-in cloud infrastructure, SSL, high availability, automatic backups. ([OutSystems][3])
* Out-of-the-box support for web, mobile, integrations, and complex data models. ([Index][4])

## 🧠 How *Pingganan* Works (High-Level Flow)

```
[User Browser] --(HTTPS)--> [OutSystems Front-End] --(Server-side logic & DB)--> [Database]
                                     ↑
                              [OutSystems API / Integration Layer]  
```

* The user opens the app in a web browser.
* OutSystems serves the front-end (HTML / JS / CSS), which renders dynamically — that’s why “JavaScript is required.”
* User interactions (like button clicks, forms) trigger server-side logic (built via OutSystems logic flows).
* Data is stored / retrieved from the backend database.
* Optionally, external integrations or APIs can be used via OutSystems integration tools.

## 🧩 Project Structure (OutSystems Modules)

Here’s a typical module breakdown (adjust based on your actual app):

| Module                    | Responsibility                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Web / UI Module**       | Screens, Navigation, UI logic, client-side interactions            |
| **Business Logic Module** | Core workflows, server-side logic, data validation, business rules |
| **Data Module**           | Entities (database tables), relationships, data model              |
| **Integration Module**    | Calls to external APIs or services (if any)                        |
| **Security Module**       | Users, roles, permissions, authentication / authorization          |

**Note:** Because OutSystems is low-code, many of these are configured visually (drag-and-drop, properties) rather than hand-coded.

## 🚀 Deployment & Hosting

* This app is hosted on **OutSystems Cloud** — meaning infrastructure (servers, load balancers, SSL) is managed for us. ([OutSystems][3])
* Database backups are automatic (daily, retained for 15 days) for data safety. ([OutSystems][3])
* The app benefits from high availability and built-in monitoring. ([OutSystems][3])

---

## 👥 Roles & Access Control

Because our app likely serves different types of users (e.g. admin, standard user), we rely on:

* **Role-based access control** — configured via OutSystems security model.
* **User authentication** — managed centrally, optionally with custom SSL / secure certificates if needed. ([OutSystems][3])

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations / Considerations

* As a low-code platform, OutSystems abstracts a lot — which is great for speed, but can limit how much you can fine-tune the generated code. ([Software Advice][5])
* Source control / branching is different than a traditional codebase — merging changes or porting to a different stack can be challenging. ([Reddit][6])
* Migration away from OutSystems (if ever required) involves careful planning — data export, re-building UI and logic, etc.

## 📝 What You Need to Use / Extend This Repo

* An **OutSystems account / license** (or Personal Environment)
* Access to the OutSystems **Service Studio** (IDE) / Lifetime console
* Basic knowledge of OutSystems modules: Entities, Logic, Screens, Navigation

---

## 💡 How to Get Started

1. Clone this repo (if you export OML/APP files) — or download the `.oml` / `.oap` file.
2. Open in OutSystems Service Studio.
3. Review entities, logic flows, and UI modules.
4. Run the app (compile + publish).
5. Log in as admin / initial user — explore features.
6. To customize: add new screens, update logic, extend data model, publish changes.

## 🎨 Why “Pingganan”?

*(You can add a fun story or brand explanation here.)*

* The name evokes **home / dinner / community** — something warm and familiar.
* The app aims to be as friendly and easy-to-use as sharing a meal — intuitive, no friction, just good service.

## 🗣 About OutSystems — In Short

OutSystems is a mature low-code platform used by organizations worldwide to build robust web and mobile apps quickly. It combines:

* Visual, model-driven development,
* Cloud-native hosting,
* Enterprise-grade infrastructure (security, scalability, monitoring). ([Techday 2024][7])

Good for rapid MVPs — but also for production-grade systems that need reliability, maintenance, and growth potential.
